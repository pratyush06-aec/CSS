<!-- In flex-boxes we have main axis and cross axis.
    FLEX Directions-
    1. Row
    2. Row Reverse
    3. Column 
    4. Column Reverse -->


<!-- In case of flex box, there's a concept called axis.
    There are two type of axis.
        1. Main Axis(horizontal in case of row direction and vertical in case of column direction. )
        2. Cross Axis(horizontal in case of column direction and vertical in case of row direction. )-->


<!-- Customized size of the divs would not be set when the display is flex, i.e, flex-box model is applied.
    The sizes would try to fit inside the container only untill and unless the text-size or the content size not very large/unfittable inside the size of the container. -->


<!-- Flex Properties:
    1. justify-content- It decides the layout for the contents inside the container. -->
