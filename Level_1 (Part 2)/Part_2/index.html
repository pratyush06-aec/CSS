<!-- Here, (<body> tag) is the parent tag of (<header>, <main>, <footer> tags) and (<p> tag) is the child tag of the previous mentioned three tags. 
        So, the main thing is, the text-alignment is set in accordance to the parent tag not according to the whole document. -->


<!-- There are three types of text-alignment-
        1. Left
        2. Right
        3. Center -->



<!-- In the latest version of CSS i.e., CSS-3 two new properties have been added, i.e., start and end which can be used in place of left and right respectively, in case of text alignment. 
        1. start- left
        2. end-right 
            But this is applicable for the languages that start from left originally and not for langauges like urdu that start from right originally. 
                So, in case of urdu like language, 
                    1. start- right
                    2. end- left-->


<!-- In case of removing under-line from any link, we use the (none) decorator. -->
<!-- line-through means cutting a line or word. -->
<!-- underline means underlining a line/word. -->
<!-- overline means line above a line/word. -->
